Expert knowledge elicitation can help, and a strong line of work focuses on directly eliciting informative prior distributions for parameters. This either requires considerable statistical expertise or is laborious, as the emphasis has been on accuracy and not on efficiency of the process. Another line of work queries about importance of features one at a time, assuming them to be independent and hence missing covariance information. In contrast, we propose eliciting expert knowledge about pairwise feature similarities, to borrow statistical strength in the predictions, and using sequential decision making techniques to minimize the effort of the expert.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Human-in-the-loop active covariance learning for improving prediction in small data sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javad Salimi Sartakhti","Homayun Afrabandpey","Nasser Ghadiri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1562716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562716800,"objectID":"4e627b29954bc1328a34b734f7628a17","permalink":"https://homayunafra.github.io/publication/2019-flstsvm/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-flstsvm/","section":"publication","summary":"Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (LST-SVM) has been shown to be an efficient and fast algorithm for binary classification.
